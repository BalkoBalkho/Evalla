Evalla is a Discord bot that lets you run code in a sandboxed enviornment. It is currently in very early beta.

Evalla is only guaranteed to work on Ubuntu, other distros havent been tested and probably wont work. Evalla needs no privellaged intents and only needs permission for sending messages that have embeds in them.
